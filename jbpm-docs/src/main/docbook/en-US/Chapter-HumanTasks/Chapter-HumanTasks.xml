  <title id="ch.human-tasks.title">Human Tasks</title>

  <para>An important aspect of business processes is human task management.  While some of
  the work performed in a process can be executed automatically, some tasks need to be 
  executed by human actors.  jBPM supports a special human task node inside processes for
  modeling this interaction with human users.  This human task node allows process designers
  to define the properties related to the task that the human actor needs to execute, like
  for example the type of task, the actor(s), the data associated with the task, etc.
  jBPM also includes a so-called human task service, a back-end service that manages the
  life cycle of these tasks at runtime.  This implementation is based on the WS-HumanTask
  specification.  Note however that this implementation is fully pluggable, meaning that
  users can integrate their own human task solution if necessary.</para>

  <para>To have human actors participate in your processes, you first need to (1) include 
  human task nodes inside your process to model the interaction with human actors, 
  (2) integrate a task management component (like for example the WS-HumanTask based
  implementation provided by jBPM) and (3) have end users interact with a human task
  client to request their task list and claim and complete the tasks assigned to them.
  Each of these three elements will be discussed in more detail in the next sections.</para>

    <para>jBPM supports the use of human tasks inside processes using a special user task
    node (as shown in the figure above).  A user task node represents an atomic task that
    needs to be executed by a human actor.  [Although jBPM has a special user task node for
    including human tasks inside a process, human tasks are considered the same as any other
    kind of external service that needs to be invoked and are therefore simply implemented
    as a domain-specific service.  Check out the chapter on domain-specific services to
    learn more about how to register your own domain-specific services.]</para>

    <para>A user task node contains the following properties:
    <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Id</emphasis>: The id of the node (which is unique
            within one node container).</para>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>TaskName</emphasis>: The name of the human task.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Priority</emphasis>: An integer indicating the priority
            of the human task.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Comment</emphasis>: A comment associated with the human
            task.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>ActorId</emphasis>: The actor id that is responsible for
             executing the human task.  A list of actor id's can be specified using
             a comma (',') as separator.</para>

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
             <para><emphasis>Skippable</emphasis>: Specifies whether the human task
             can be skipped, i.e., whether the actor may decide not to execute the
             task.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Content</emphasis>: The data associated with this task.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Swimlane</emphasis>: The swimlane this human task node
            is part of.  Swimlanes make it easy to assign multiple human tasks to
            the same actor.  See the human tasks chapter for more detail on how to
            use swimlanes.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>On entry and on exit actions</emphasis>: Action scripts
            that are executed upon entry and exit of this node, respectively.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Parameter mapping</emphasis>: Allows copying the value
            of process variables to parameters of the human task.  Upon creation of
            the human tasks, the values will be copied.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Result mapping</emphasis>: Allows copying the value 
            of result parameters of the human task to a process variable.  Upon
            completion of the human task, the values will be copied.  A human task
            has a result variable "Result" that contains
            the data returned by the human actor.  The variable "ActorId" contains
            the id of the actor that actually executed the task.</para>
          </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>You can edit these variables in the properties view (see below) when selecting
    the user task node, or the most important properties can also be edited by 
    double-clicking the user task node, after which a custom user task node editor is 
    opened, as shown below as well.</para>

    <para>In many cases, the parameters of a user task (like for example the task name, 
    actorId, priority, etc.) can be defined when creating the process.  You simply fill in
    value of these properties in the property editor.  It is however likely that some
    of the properties of the human task are dependent on some data related to the process
    instance this task is being requested in.  For example, if a business process is used
    to model how to handle incoming sales requests, tasks that are assigned to a sales
    representative could include information related to that specific sales request, like
    its unique id, the name of the customer that requested it, etc.  You can make your
    human task properties dynamic in two ways:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>#{expression}: Task parameters of type String can use #{expression} to embed the value of 
        the given expression in the String.  For example, the comment related to a task
        might be "Please review this request from user #{user}", where user is a variable
        in the process.  At runtime, #{user} will be replaced by the actual user name for
        that specific process instance.  The value of #{expression} will be resolved when
        creating human task and the #{...} will be replaced by the toString() value of the
        value it resolves to.  The expression could simply be the name of a variable (in
        which case it will be resolved to the value of the variable), but more advanced
        MVEL expressions are possible as well, like for example #{person.name.firstname}.
        Note that this approach can only be used for String parameters.  Other parameters
        should use parameter mapping to map a value to that parameter.</listitem>
        <listitem>Parameter mapping: You can map the value of a process variable (or a 
        value derived from a variable) to a task parameter.  For example, if you need to
        assign a task to a user whose id is a variable in your process, you can do so
        by mapping that variable to the parameter ActorId, as shown in the following
        screenshot.  [Note that, for parameters of type String, this would be identical
        to specifying the ActorId using #{userVariable}, so it would probably be easier
        to use #{expression} in this case, but parameter mapping also allow you to assign
        a value to properties that are not of type String.]</listitem>

    <section>
      <title>User and group assignment</title>
      
      <para>Tasks can be assigned to one specific user.  In that case, the task will show
      up on the task list of that specific user only.  If a task is assigned to more than
      one user, any of those users can claim and execute this task.</para>
      
      <para>Tasks can also be assigned to one or more groups.  This means that any user
      that is part of the group can claim and execute the task.  For more information on
      how user and group management is handled in the default human task service, check
      out the user and group assignment.</para>
      
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Data mapping</title>
      
      <para>Human tasks typically present some data related to the task that needs to be
      performed to the actor that is executing the task and usually also request the actor
      to provide some result data related to the execution of the task.  Task forms are
      typically used to present this data to the actor and request results.</para>
      
      <section>
        <title>Task parameters</title>
      
      <para>Data that needs to be displayed in a task form should be passed to the task,
      using parameter mapping.  Parameter mapping allows you to copy the value of a
      process variable to a task parameter (as described above).  This could for example
      be the customer name that needs to be displayed in the task form, the actual request,
      etc.  To copy data to the task, simply map the variable to a task parameter.  This
      parameter will then be accessible in the task form (as shown later, when describing
      how to create task forms).</para>
      
      <para>For example, the following human task (as part of the humantask example in 
      jbpm-examples) is assigned to a sales representative that needs to decide whether
      to accept or reject a request from a customer.  Therefore, it copies the following
      process variables to the task as task parameters: the userId (of the customer doing
      the request), the description (of the request), and the date (of the request).</para>

      </section>
      
      <section>
        <title>Task results</title>
        
        <para>Data that needs to be returned to the process should be mapped from the
        task back into process variables, using result mapping.  Result mapping allows you
        to copy the value of a task result to a process variable (as described above).
        This could for example be some data that the actor filled in.  To copy a task
        result to a process variable, simply map the task result parameter to the variable
        in the result mapping.  The value of the task result will then be copied after
        completion of the task so it can be used in the remainder of the process.</para>
        
        <para>For example, the following human task (as part of the humantask example in 
      jbpm-examples) is assigned to a sales representative that needs to decide whether
      to accept or reject a request from a customer.  Therefore, it copies the following
      task results back to the process: the outcome (the decision that the sales 
      representative has made regarding this request, in this case "Accept" or "Reject")
      and the comment (the justification why).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Swimlanes</title>

      <para>User tasks can be used in combination with swimlanes to assign multiple human tasks
      to the same actor.  Whenever the first task in a swimlane is created, and that task
      has an actorId specified, that actorId will be assigned to (all other tasks of) that
      swimlane as well.  Note that this would override the actorId of subsequent tasks in
      that swimlane (if specified), so only the actorId of the first human task in a swimlane
      will be taken into account, all others will then take the actorId as assigned in the
      first one.</para>

      <para>Whenever a human task that is part of a swimlane is completed, the actorId of that swimlane is
      set to the actorId that executed that human task.  This allows for example to assign a human task to
      a group of users, and to assign future tasks of that swimlame to the user that claimed the first task.
      This will also automatically change the assignment of tasks if at some point one of the tasks is
      reassigned to another user.</para>

      <para>To add a human task to a swimlane, simply specify the name of the swimlane as the value of the
      "Swimlane" parameter of the user task node.  A process must also define all the swimlanes that it contains.
      To do so, open the process properties by clicking on the background of the process and click on the
      "Swimlanes" property.  You can add new swimlanes there.</para>
      
      <para>The new BPMN2 Eclipse editor will support a visual representation of swimlanes
      (as horizontal lanes), so that it will be possible to define a human task as part of
      a swimlane simply by dropping the task in that lane on the process model.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Examples</title>
      
      <para>The jbpm-examples module has some examples that show human tasks in action, like
      the evaluation example and the humantask example.  These examples show some of the
      more advanced features in action, like for example group assignment, data passing in
      and out of human tasks, swimlanes, etc.  Be sure to take a look at them for more
      details and a working example.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Human task service</title>

    <para>As far as the jBPM engine is concerned, human tasks are similar to any other external
    service that needs to be invoked and are implemented as a domain-specific service.  Check
    out the chapter on domain-specific services for more detail on how to include a domain-
    specific service in your process.  Because a human task is an example of such a domain-
    specific service, the process itself contains a high-level, abstract description of the
    human task that need to be executed, and a work item handler is responsible for binding
    this abstract tasks to a specific implementation.  Using our pluggable work item handler
    approach, users can plug in the human task service that is provided by jBPM, as descrived
    below, or they may register their own implementation.</para>

    <para>The jBPM project provide a default implementation of a human task service based on the
    WS-HumanTask specification.  If you do not have the requirement to integrate an existing human
    task service, you can use this service.  It manages the life cycle of the tasks (creation,
    claiming, completion, etc.) and stores the state of all the tasks, task lists, etc.  It also
    supports features like internationalization, calendar integration, different types of
    assignments, delegation, deadlines, etc.  It is implemented as part of the jbpm-human-task
    module.</para>

    <para>The task service implementation is based on the WS-HumanTask (WS-HT) specification.
    This specification defines (in detail) the model of the tasks, the life cycle, and a lot
    of other features as the ones mentioned above. It is pretty comprehensive and can be found
    <ulink url="http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/specs/ws-bpel4people/WS-HumanTask_v1.pdf">
    here</ulink>.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Task life cycle</title>
    
      <para>Looking from the perspective of the process, whenever a user task node
      is triggered during the execution of a process instance, a human task is created.
      The process will only leave that node when that human task has been completed
      or aborted.</para>
      
      <para>The human task itself usually has a complete life cycle itself as well. We
      will now shortly introduce this life cycle, as shown in the figure below. For more
      details, check out the WS-HumanTask specification.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata scalefit="1" align="center" width="100%"
                     fileref="images/Chapter-HumanTasks/WSHT-lifecycle.png" format="PNG" role="" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Whenever a task is created, it starts in the "Created" stage.  It 
      usually automatically transfers to the
      "Ready" state, at which point the task will show up on the task list of
      all the actors that are allowed to execute
      the task.  There, it is waiting for one of these actors to claim the
      task, indicating that he or she will be
      executing the task.  Once a user has claimed a task, the status is changed
      to "Reserved".  Note that a task that
      only has one potential actor will automatically be assigned to that actor
      upon creation of that task.  After claiming
      the task, that user can then at some point decide to start executing the
      task, in which case the task status is
      changed to "InProgress".  Finally, once the task has been performed, the
      user must complete the task (and can specify
      the result data related to the task), in which case the status is changed
      to "Completed".  If the task could not be
      completed, the user can also indicate this using a fault response (possibly
      with fault data associated), in which
      case the status is changed to "Failed".</para>

      <para>The life cycle explained above is the normal life cycle.  The service
      also allows a lot of other life cycle  methods, like:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>Delegating or forwarding a task, in which case it is assigned
        to another actor</listitem>
        <listitem>Revoking a task, so it is no longer claimed by one specific 
        actor but reappears on the task list of
        all potential actors</listitem>
        <listitem>Temporarly suspending and resuming a task</listitem>
        <listitem>Stopping a task in progress</listitem>
        <listitem>Skipping a task (if the task has been marked as skippable),
        in which case the task will not be executed</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Linking the human task service to the jBPM engine</title>

      <para>The human task service needs to be integrated with the jBPM engine just like
      any other external service, by registering a work item handler that is responsible
      for translating the abstract work item (in this case a human task) to a specific
      invocation of a service.  We have implemented this work item handler
      (org.jbpm.process.workitem.wsht.WSHumanTaskHandler in the jbpm-human-task module),
      so you can register this work item handler like this:</para>
      <programlisting language="java">StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = ...;
ksession.getWorkItemManager().registerWorkItemHandler("Human Task", new WSHumanTaskHandler());</programlisting>

      <para>If you are using persistence, you should use the CommandBasedWSHumanTaskHandler
      instead (org.jbpm.process.workitem.wsht.CommandBasedWSHumanTaskHandler in the 
      jbpm-human-task module), like this:</para>
      <programlisting language="java">StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = ...;
ksession.getWorkItemManager().registerWorkItemHandler("Human Task", new CommandBasedWSHumanTaskHandler());</programlisting>

      <para>By default, this handler will connect to the human task service on the local
      machine on port 9123.  You can easily change the address and port of the human task
      service that should be used by by invoking the setConnection(ipAddress, port)
      method on the WSHumanTaskHandler.</para>
      
      <para>The communication between the human task service and the process engine,
      or any task client, is done using messages being sent between the client and the
      server.  The implementation allows different transport mechanisms being plugged
      in, but by default, Mina
      <ulink url="http://mina.apache.org/">(http://mina.apache.org/)</ulink> is used
      for client/server communication. An alternative implementation using HornetQ
      is also available.</para>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Interacting with the human task service</title>

      <para>The human task service exposes various methods to manage the life cycle of
      the tasks through a Java API.  This allows clients to integrate (at a low level) 
      with the human task service.  Note that end users should probably will not interact
      with this low-level API directly but rather use one of the more user-friendly task
      clients (see below) that offer a graphical user interface to request task lists,
      claim and complete tasks, etc.  These task clients internally interact with the 
      human task service using this API as well.  But the low-level API is also available
      for developers to interact with the human task service directly.</para>
      
      <para>A task client (class org.jbpm.task.service.TaskClient) offers the following
      methods for managing the life cycle of human tasks:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">public void start( long taskId, String userId, TaskOperationResponseHandler responseHandler )
public void stop( long taskId, String userId, TaskOperationResponseHandler responseHandler )
public void release( long taskId, String userId, TaskOperationResponseHandler responseHandler )
public void suspend( long taskId, String userId, TaskOperationResponseHandler responseHandler )
public void resume( long taskId, String userId, TaskOperationResponseHandler responseHandler )
public void skip( long taskId, String userId, TaskOperationResponseHandler responseHandler )
public void delegate( long taskId, String userId, String targetUserId,
                      TaskOperationResponseHandler responseHandler )
public void complete( long taskId, String userId, ContentData outputData,
                      TaskOperationResponseHandler responseHandler )
...</programlisting>

      <para>If you take a look a the method signatures you will notice that almost all of
      these methods take the following arguments:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">taskId</emphasis>:
          The id of the task that we are working with. This is usually extracted from the
          currently selected task in the user task list in the user interface.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">userId</emphasis>: The id of the user
          that is executing the action. This is usually the id of the user that is
          logged in into the application.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">responseHandler</emphasis>: Communication with
          the task service is asynchronous, so you should use a response handler
          that will be notified when the results are available.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>When you invoke a message on the TaskClient, a message is created that
      will be sent to the server, and the server will execute the logic that
      implements the correct action.</para>

      <para>The following code sample shows how to create a task client and interact with
      the task service to create, start and complete a task.</para>

      <programlisting language="java">TaskClient client = new TaskClient(new MinaTaskClientConnector("client 1",
    new MinaTaskClientHandler(SystemEventListenerFactory.getSystemEventListener())));
client.connect("127.0.0.1", 9123);

      <title>User and group assignment</title>
      
      <para>Tasks can be assigned to one specific user.  In that case, the task will show
      up on the task list of that specific user only.  If a task is assigned to more than
      one user, any of those users can claim and execute this task.  Tasks can also be 
      assigned to one or more groups.  This means that any user that is part of the group
      can claim and execute the task.</para>
      
      <para>The human task service needs to know about valid user and group
      ids (to make sure tasks are assigned to existing users and/or groups to avoid
      errors and tasks that end up assigned to non-existing users). User and group registration has to be done before tasks can be assigned to them.  
      One possible registration method is to dynamically adding users and groups to the task service session:</para>
      
<programlisting language="java">EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("org.jbpm.task");
TaskService taskService = new TaskService(emf, SystemEventListenerFactory.getSystemEventListener());
TaskServiceSession taskSession = taskService.createSession();
// now register new users and groups
taskSession.addUser(new User("krisv"));
taskSession.addGroup(new Group("developers"));</programlisting>

      <para>The human task service itself does not maintain the relationship between users
      and groups.  This is considered outside the scope of the human task service, as in
      general businesses already have existing services that contain this information (like
      for example an LDAP service).  Therefore, the human task service also offers you
      to specify the list of groups that a user is part of, so this information can also
      be taken into account when for example requesting the task list or claiming a task.
      </para>
      
      <para>For example, if a task is assigned to the group "sales" and the user "sales-rep"
      that is part of that group wants to claim that task, he should pass the fact that he
      is part of that group when requesting the list of tasks that he is assigned to as
      potential owner:</para>
      
<programlisting language="java">List&lt;String&gt; groups = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
groups.add("sales");
taskClient.getTasksAssignedAsPotentialOwner("sales-rep", groups, "en-UK", taskSummaryHandler);</programlisting>
      
      <para>The WS-HumanTask specification also introduces the role of an administrator.
      An administrator can manipulate the life cycle of the task, even though he might not
      be assigned as a potential owner of that task.  By default, jBPM registers a special
      user with userId "Administrator" as the administrator of each task.  You should 
      therefor make sure that you always define at least a user "Adminstrator" when
      registering the list of valid users at the task service.</para>
      
      <para>
      It is often necessary to hook into existing systems and/or services (such as LDAP) where users and groups 
      are maintained in order to perform validation without having to manually register all users and group with the task service. 
      jBPM provides the UserGroupCallback interface which allows you to create your own implementation for user and group management:</para>
      
<programlisting language="java">
public interface UserGroupCallback {
	/**
	 * Resolves existence of user id.
	 * @param userId	the user id assigned to the task
	 * @return true if userId exists, false otherwise.
	 */
    boolean existsUser(String userId);
    
    /**
     * Resolves existence of group id.
     * @param groupId	the group id assigned to the task
     * @return true if groupId exists, false otherwise.
     */
    boolean existsGroup(String groupId);
    
    /**
     * Returns list of group ids for specified user id.
     * @param userId	the user id assigned to the task
     * @param groupIds  list of group ids assigned to the task
     * @param allExistingGroupIds	list of all currently known group ids
     * @return List of group ids.
     */
    List&lt;String&gt; getGroupsForUser(String userId, List&lt;String&gt; groupIds, List&lt;String&gt; allExistingGroupIds);
}</programlisting>      
      
      <para>
      	If you register your own implementation of the UserGroupCallback interface, the human task service will call it whenever it needs to 
      	perform user and group validation. Here is a very simple example implementation which treats all users and groups as being valid:  
      </para>

<programlisting language="java">
public class DefaultUserGroupCallbackImpl implements UserGroupCallback {

	public boolean existsUser(String userId) {
		// accept all by default
		return true;
	}

	public boolean existsGroup(String groupId) {
		// accept all by default
		return true;
	}
	
	public List&lt;String&gt; getGroupsForUser(String userId, List&lt;String&gt; groupIds,
			List&lt;String&gt; allExistingGroupIds) {
		if(groupIds != null) {
			List&lt;String&gt; retList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(groupIds);
			// merge all groups
			if(allExistingGroupIds != null) {
				for(String grp : allExistingGroupIds) {
					if(!retList.contains(grp)) {
						retList.add(grp);
					}
				}
			} 
			return retList;
		} else {
			// return empty list by default
			return new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
		}
	}
}
</programlisting>     
      
      <para> 
      You can register your own implementation of the UserGroupCallback interface in a properties file called jbpm.usergroup.callback.properties which should be available on the classpath, for example:
      </para>

<programlisting language="java">
jbpm.usergroup.callback=org.jbpm.task.service.DefaultUserGroupCallbackImpl
</programlisting>
   
      <para>
      or via a system property, for example -Djbpm.usergroup.callback=org.jbpm.task.service.DefaultUserGroupCallbackImpl. If you are using the jBPM installer, you can also modify
      $jbpm-installer-dir$/task-service/resources/org/jbpm/jbpm.usergroup.callback.properties directly to register your own callback implementation.

      <title>Starting the human task service</title>

      <para>The human task service is a completely independent service
      that the process engine communicates with.  We therefore recommend to
      start it as a separate service as well.  The installer contains a command
      to start the task server (in this case using Mina as transport protocol),
      or you can use the following code fragment:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("org.jbpm.task");
TaskService taskService = new TaskService(emf, SystemEventListenerFactory.getSystemEventListener());
MinaTaskServer server = new MinaTaskServer( taskService );
Thread thread = new Thread( server );
thread.start();</programlisting>

      <para>The task management component uses the Java Persistence API (JPA) to
      store all task information in a persistent manner.  To configure the
      persistence, you need to modify the persistence.xml configuration file
      accordingly.  We refer to the JPA documentation on how to do that.  The
      following fragment shows for example how to use the task management component
      with hibernate and an in-memory H2 database:</para>

      <para>The first time you start the task management component, you need to
      make sure that all the necessary users and groups are added to the database.
      Our implementation requires all users and groups to be predefined before
      trying to assign a task to that user or group.  So you need to make sure
      you add the necessary users and group to the database using the
      taskSession.addUser(user) and taskSession.addGroup(group) methods.  Note
      that you at least need an "Administrator" user as all tasks are
      automatically assigned to this user as the administrator role.</para>

      <para>The jbpm-human-task module contains a org.jbpm.task.RunTaskService
      class in the src/test/java source folder that can be used to start a task server.
      It automatically adds users and groups as defined in LoadUsers.mvel and
      LoadGroups.mvel configuration files.</para>
      
      <para>The jBPM installer automatically starts a human task service (using an
      in-memory H2 database) as a separate Java application.  This task service is defined

      new users and task by modifying the LoadUsers.mvel and LoadGroups.mvel scripts
      in the resources directory.</para>

      <para>The Drools IDE contains a org.drools.eclipse.task plugin that allows you to test and/or debug
      processes using human tasks.  In contains a Human Task View that can connect to a running task
      management component, request the relevant tasks for a particular user (i.e. the tasks where the user
      is either a potential owner or the tasks that the user already claimed and is executing).  The
      life cycle of these tasks can then be executed, i.e. claiming or releasing a task, starting or
      stopping the execution of a task, completing a task, etc.  A screenshot of this Human Task View is
      shown below.  You can configure which task management component to connect to in the Drools Task
      preference page (select Window -> Preferences and select Drools Task).  Here you can specify the
      url and port (default = 127.0.0.1:9123).</para>
