  <para>A business process is a graph that describes the order in which a series of steps need to
  be executed, using a flow chart.  A process consists of a collection of nodes that are
  linked to each other using connections.  Each of the nodes represents one step in the
  overall process while the connections specify how to transition from one node to the other.
  A large selection of predefined node types have been defined.  This chapter describes how
  to define such processes and use them in your application.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Creating a process</title>

    <para>Processes can be created by using one of the following three methods:
    <orderedlist>
       <listitem>Using the graphical process editor in the Eclipse plugin</listitem>
       <listitem>As an XML file, according to the XML process format as defined in the
       XML Schema Definition in the BPMN 2.0 specification.</listitem>
       <listitem>By directly creating a process using the Process API.</listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>Using the graphical BPMN2 Editor</title>

      <para>The graphical BPMN2 editor is an editor that allows you to create a process
      by dragging and dropping different nodes on a canvas and editing the properties of these
      nodes.  The graphical BPMN2 editor is part of the jBPM / Drools Eclipse plugin.  Once
      you have set up a jBPM project (see the installer for creating a working Eclipse
      environment where you can start), you can start adding processes.  When in a project,
      launch the "New" wizard (use Ctrl+N) or right-click the directory you would like to put
      your process in and select "New", then "File".  Give the file a name and the extension
      bpmn (e.g. MyProcess.bpmn).  This will open up the process editor (you can safely ignore
      the warning that the file could not be read, this is just because the file is still
      empty).</para>

      <para>First, ensure that you can see the Properties View down the bottom of the Eclipse window,
      as it will be necessary to fill in the different properties of the elements  in your process.  If you cannot
      see the properties view, open it using the menu "Window", then "Show View" and
      "Other...", and under the "General" folder select the Properties View.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The process editor consists of a palette, a canvas and an outline view.
      To add new elements to the canvas, select the element you would like to create
      in the palette and then add them to the canvas by clicking on the preferred
      location.  For example,  click on the "End Event" icon in the "Components"
      palette of the GUI. Clicking on an 
      element in your process allows you to set the properties of that element. You
      can connect the nodes (as long as it is permitted by the different types
      of nodes) by using "Sequence Flow" from the "Components" palette.</para>

      <para>You can keep adding nodes and connections to your process until it
      represents the business logic that you want to specify.</para>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Defining processes using XML</title>

      <para>It is also possible to specify processes using the underlying BPMN 2.0 XML directly.
      The syntax of these XML processes is defined using the BPMN 2.0 XML Schema Definition.
      For example, the following XML fragment shows a simple process that contains a
      sequence of a Start Event, a Script Task that prints "Hello World" to the console,
      and an End Event.</para>

      <para>The process XML file consists of two parts, the top part (the "process" element)
      contains the definition of the different nodes and their properties, the lower part (the
      "BPMNDiagram" element) contains all graphical information, like the location of the nodes.
      The process XML consist of exactly one &lt;process&gt; element.
      This element contains parameters related to the process (its type, name, id and
      package name),  and consists of three subsections: a header section (where
      process-level information like variables, globals, imports and lanes can be
      defined), a nodes section that defines each of the nodes in the process,
      and a connections section that contains the connections between all the nodes
      in the process. In the nodes section, there is a specific element for each node,
      defining the various parameters and, possibly, sub-elements for that node type.</para>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Defining Processes Using the Process API</title>

      <para>While it is recommended to define processes using the graphical editor or
      the underlying XML (to shield yourself from internal APIs), it is also possible
      to define a process using the Process API directly. The most important process
      model elements are defined in the packages <code>org.jbpm.workflow.core</code> and
      <code>org.jbpm.workflow.core.node</code>.  A "fluent API" is provided that
      allows you to easily construct processes in a readable manner using factories.
      At the end, you can validate the process that you were constructing manually.
      </para>
      
      <section>
        <title>Example</title>

      <para>This is a simple example of a basic process with a script task only:</para>
      <programlisting language="java">
RuleFlowProcessFactory factory =
    RuleFlowProcessFactory.createProcess("org.jbpm.HelloWorld");
factory
    // Header
    .name("HelloWorldProcess")
    .version("1.0")
    .packageName("org.jbpm")
    // Nodes
    .startNode(1).name("Start").done()
    .actionNode(2).name("Action")
        .action("java", "System.out.println(\"Hello World\");").done()
    .endNode(3).name("End").done()
    // Connections
    .connection(1, 2)
    .connection(2, 3);
RuleFlowProcess process = factory.validate().getProcess();
KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
kbuilder.add(ResourceFactory.newByteArrayResource(
    XmlBPMNProcessDumper.INSTANCE.dump(process).getBytes()), ResourceType.BPMN2);
KnowledgeBase kbase = kbuilder.newKnowledgeBase();
StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatefulKnowledgeSession();
ksession.startProcess("org.jbpm.HelloWorld");</programlisting>
        
      <para>You can see that we start by calling the static <code>createProcess()</code>
      method from the <code>RuleFlowProcessFactory</code> class.  This method creates
      a new process with the given id and returns the <code>RuleFlowProcessFactory</code>
      that can be used to create the process.  A typical process consists of three parts.
      The header part comprises global elements like the name of the process, imports,
      variables,  etc.  The nodes section contains all the different nodes that are part of the
      process. The connections section finally links these nodes to each other
      to create a flow chart.</para>

      <para>In this example, the header contains the name and the version of the
      process and the package name. After that, you can start adding nodes to the
      current process. If you have auto-completion you can see that you have
      different methods to create each of the supported node types at your disposal.</para>

      <para>When you start adding nodes to the process, in this example by calling
      the <code>startNode()</code>, <code>actionNode()</code> and <code>endNode()</code>
      methods, you can see that these methods return a specific <code>NodeFactory</code>,
      that allows you to set the properties of that node.  Once you have finished
      configuring that specific node, the <code>done()</code> method returns you to the
      current <code>RuleFlowProcessFactory</code> so you can add more nodes, if necessary.</para>

      <para>When you are finished adding nodes, you must connect them by creating
      connections between them.  This can be done by calling the  method
      <code>connection</code>, which will link previously created nodes.</para>

      <para>Finally, you can validate the generated process by calling the
      <code>validate()</code> method and retrieve the created
      <code>RuleFlowProcess</code> object.</para>

    <title>Details of different process constructs: Overview</title>
  
  <para>The following chapters will describe the different constructs that you can use
  to model your processes (and their properties) in detail.  Executable processes in BPMN consist
  of different types of nodes being connected to each other using sequence flows.
  The BPMN 2.0 specification defines three main types of nodes:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><emphasis>Events</emphasis>: They are used to model the occurrence of a particular
    event.  This could be a start event (that is used to indicate the start of the process), end
    events (that define the end of the process, or of that subflow) and intermediate events (that
    indicate events that might occur during the execution of the process).</listitem>
    <listitem><emphasis>Activities</emphasis>: These define the different actions that need to be
    performed during the execution of the process.  Different types of tasks exist, depending on 
    the type of activity you are trying to model (e.g. human task, service task, etc.) and activities
    could also be nested (using different types of sub-processes).</listitem>
    <listitem><emphasis>Gateways</emphasis>: Can be used to define multiple paths in the process.
    Depending on the type of gateway, these might indicate parallel execution, choice, etc.</listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>The following sections will describe the properties of the process itself and of each of
  these different node types in detail, as supported by the Eclipse plugin and shown in the
  following figure of the palette.  Note that the Eclipse property editor might show more properties
  for some of the supported node types, but only the properties as defined in this section are
  supported when using the BPMN 2.0 XML format.</para>

    <title>Details: Process properties</title>
    
    <para>A BPMN2 process is a flow chart where different types of nodes are
    linked using connections.  The process itself exposes the following properties:

      <para>The start of the process.
        A process should have exactly one start node, which cannot have
        incoming connections and should have one outgoing connection.  Whenever a
        process is started, execution will start at this node and 
        automatically continue to the first node linked to this start event, and
        so on. It contains the following properties:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Id</emphasis>: The id of the node (which is unique

      </figure>

        <para>The end of the process.  A process
        should have one or more end events.  The End Event should have one incoming
        connection and cannot have any outgoing connections.  It contains the following
        properties:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem> 
            <para><emphasis>Id</emphasis>: The id of the node (which is unique within
            one node container).</para>

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Terminate</emphasis>: An End Event can terminate
            the entire process or just the path. When a process instance is
            terminated, it means its state is set to completed and all other nodes 
            that might still be active (on parallel paths) in this
            process instance are cancelled. Non-terminating end events are simply ends
            for this path (execution of this branch will end here), but other parallel
            paths can still continue.  A process instance will automatically complete
            if there are no more active paths inside that process instance (for example,
            if a process instance reaches a non-terminating end node but there are no
            more active branches inside the process instance, the process instance
            will be completed anyway).  Terminating end events are
            visualized using a full circle inside the event node, non-terminating event
            nodes are empty.  Note that, if you use a terminating event node inside a sub-process,
            you are terminating the top-level process instance, not just that sub-process.</para>

        <para>An Error Event can be used
        to signal an exceptional condition in the process.  It should
        have one incoming connection and no outgoing connections.  When an Error Event
        is reached in the process, it will throw an error with the given name.
        The process will search for an appropriate error handler that is
        capable of handling this kind of fault.  If no error handler is found,
        the process instance will be aborted.  An Error Event contains the following
        properties:</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        
        <para>Error handlers can be specified using boundary events.  This is however

        <para>Represents a timer that can
        trigger one or multiple times after a given period of time.  A Timer Event
        should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.  The timer
        delay specifies how long the timer should wait before
        triggering the first time.  When a Timer Event is reached in the process, it will
        start the associated timer.  The timer is cancelled if the timer node is
        cancelled (e.g., by completing or aborting the enclosing process instance). Consult the
        section <quote><link linkend='sec.timers' endterm="sec.timers.title"/></quote>

            hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds (which is the default if you don't
            specify anything).  For example, the expression "1h" will wait one hour

            dynamically derive the delay based on some process variable.  Expr in this

        <para>A Signal Event can be used
        to respond to internal or external events during the execution of the process.
        A Signal Event should have no incoming connections and one outgoing
        connection.  It specifies the type of event that is expected.  Whenever
        that type of event is detected, the node connected to this event node will
        be triggered.  It contains the following properties:</para>

        <para>Represents a script that
        should be executed in this process.  A Script Task should have one incoming
        connection and one outgoing connection.  The associated action specifies what
        should be executed, the dialect used for coding the action (i.e., Java or MVEL),
        and the actual action code.  This code can access any variables and globals.
        There is also a predefined variable <code>kcontext</code> that references the
        <code>ProcessContext</code> object (which can,
        for example, be used to access the current <code>ProcessInstance</code> or
        <code>NodeInstance</code>, and to get and set variables, or get access to the
        ksession using <code>kcontext.getKnowledgeRuntime()</code>). When a Script Task
        is reached in the process, it will execute the action and then continue with the
        next node.  It contains the following properties:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Id</emphasis>: The id of the node (which is unique within

        <para>Note that you can write any valid Java code inside a script node.  This
        basically allows you to do anything inside such a script node.  There are some
        caveats however:
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>When trying to create a higher-level business process, that should
            also be understood by business users, it is probably wise to avoid low-level
            implementation details inside the process, including inside these script tasks.
            A Script Task could still be used to quickly manipulate variables etc. but
            other concepts like a Service Task could be used to model more complex
            behaviour in a higher-level manner.</listitem>
            <listitem>Scripts should be immediate.  They are using the engine thread
            to execute the script.  Scripts that could take some time to execute should
            probably be modeled as an asynchronous Service Task.</listitem>
            <listitem>You should try to avoid contacting external services through a
            script node.  Not only does this usually violate the first two caveats, it
            is also interacting with external services without the knowledge of the engine,
            which can be problematic, especially when using persistence and transactions.
            In general, it is probably wiser to model communication with an external
            service using a service task.</listitem>
            <listitem>Scripts should not throw exceptions.  Runtime exceptions should
            be caught and for example managed inside the script or transformed into
            signals or errors that can then be handled inside the process.</listitem>

        <para>Represents an (abstract)
        unit of work that should be executed in this process.  All work that is
        executed outside the process engine should be represented (in a declarative
        way) using a Service Task.  Different types of services are predefined, e.g.,
        sending an email, logging a message, etc.  Users can define domain-specific
        services or work items, using a unique name and by defining
        the parameters (input) and results (output) that are associated with this
        type of work.  Check the chapter on domain-specific processes for a
        detailed explanation and illustrative examples of how to define and use
        work items in your processes.  When a Service Task is reached in the
        process, the associated work is executed.  A Service Task should
        have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.</para>

            type of work can define result parameters that will (potentially)
            be returned after the work item has been completed.  A result
            mapping can be used to copy the value of the given result parameter
            to the given variable in this process.  For example, the "FileFinder"
            work item returns a list of files that match the given search
            criteria within the result parameter <code>Files</code>.  This list
            of files can then be bound to a process variable for use within the
            process.  Upon completion of the work item, the values will be copied.</para>

            <para><emphasis>Additional parameters</emphasis>: Each type of work
            item can define additional parameters that are relevant for that
            type of work.  For example, the "Email" work item defines additional
            parameters such as <code>From</code>, <code>To</code>, <code>Subject</code>
            and <code>Body</code>.  The user can either provide values for these
            parameters directly, or define a
            parameter mapping that will copy the value of the given variable
            in this process to the given parameter; if both are specified, the
            mapping will have precedence.  Parameters of type <code>String</code> can use
            <emphasis><code>#{expression}</code></emphasis> to embed a value in the
            string.  The value will be retrieved when creating the work item, and the
            substitution expression will be replaced by the result of calling
            <code>toString()</code> on the variable.  The expression could
            simply be the name of a variable (in which case it resolves
            to the value of the variable), but more advanced MVEL expressions
            are possible as well, e.g., <code>#{person.name.firstname}</code>.</para>

        <para>Processes can also
        involve tasks that need to be executed by human actors.  A User Task
        represents an atomic task to be executed by a human actor.  It

        User Tasks can be used in combination with Swimlanes to assign multiple
        human tasks to similar actors. Refer to the chapter on human tasks

        <para>A Business Rule Task Represents a set of rules that need to be 
        evaluated.  The rules are evaluated when the node is reached.  A Rule 
        Task should have one incoming connection and one outgoing connection.  
        Rules are defined in separate files using the Drools rule format.  Rules 
        can become part of a specific ruleflow group using the <literal>ruleflow-group</literal> 
        attribute in the header of the rule.</para>

        <para>When a Rule Task is reached in the process, the engine will start 
        executing rules that are part of the corresponding ruleflow-group (if any).  
        Execution will automatically continue to the next node if there are 
        no more active rules in this ruleflow group. As a result, during the 
        execution of a ruleflow group, new activations belonging to the currently active
        ruleflow group can be added to the Agenda due to changes made to the facts by
        the other rules. Note that the process will immediately continue with the

        at that time.</para>

        <para>A Sub-Process is 
        a node that can contain other nodes so that it acts as a node container.
        This allows not only the embedding of a part of the process within such
        a sub-process node, but also the definition of additional variables that
        are accessible for all nodes inside this container. A sub-process should
        have one incoming connection and one
        outgoing connection. It should also contain one start node that defines
        where to start (inside the Sub-Process) when you reach the sub-process.
        It should also contain one or more end events.  Note that, if you use a
        terminating event node inside a sub-process, you are terminating the 
        top-level process instance, not just that sub-process, so in general you
        should use non-terminating end nodes inside a sub-process. A sub-process
        ends when there are no more active nodes inside the sub-process.

    <title>Using a process in your application</title>

    <para>As explained in more detail in the API chapter, there are two things you
    need to do to be able to execute processes from within your application: (1) you
    need to create a Knowledge Base that contains the definition of the process, and
    (2) you need to start the process by creating a session to communicate with the
    process engine and start the process.</para>

    <orderedlist>

      <listitem><para><emphasis>Creating a Knowledge Base</emphasis>: Once you
      have a valid process, you can add the process to the Knowledge Base:</para>
      <programlisting language="java">
KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
kbuilder.add( ResourceFactory.newClassPathResource("MyProcess.bpmn2"),
              ResourceType.BPMN2 );</programlisting>
      <para>After adding all your process to the builder (you can add more
      than one process), you can create a new knowledge base
      like this:</para>
      <programlisting language="java">
KnowledgeBase kbase = kbuilder.newKnowledgeBase();</programlisting>
      <para>Note that this will throw an exception if the knowledge base contains
      errors (because it could not parse your processes correctly).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para><emphasis>Starting a process</emphasis>: To start a particular
      process, you will need to call the <code>startProcess</code> method on your session
      and pass the id of the process you want to start. For example:</para>
      <programlisting language="java">
StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatefulKnowledgeSession();
ksession.startProcess("com.sample.hello");</programlisting>
      <para>The parameter of the <code>startProcess</code> method is the id
      of the process that needs to be started. When defining a process, this
      process id needs to be specified as a property of the process (as for example
      shown in the Properties View in Eclipse when you click the background canvas
      of your process).</para>

      <para>When you start the process, you may specify additional parameters that are
      used to pass additional input data to the process, using the
      <code>startProcess(String processId, Map parameters)</code> method. The
      additional set of parameters is a set of name-value pairs. These parameters
      are copied to the newly created process instance as top-level variables
      of the process, so they can be accessed in the remainder of your process directly.

    <title id='sec.data.title'>Data</title>

    <para>While the flow chart focuses on specifying the control flow of the
    process, it is usually also necessary to look at the process from a data
    perspective.  Throughout the execution of a process, data can retrieved,
    stored, passed on and used.</para>

    <para>For storing runtime data, during the execution of the process,
    process variables can be used.  A variable is defined by a name and a data type.
    This could be a basic data type, such as boolean, int, or String, or any kind of
    Object subclass.  Variables can be defined inside a variable
    <emphasis>scope</emphasis>.  The top-level
    scope is the variable scope of the process itself.  Subscopes can be
    defined using a Sub-Process.  Variables that are defined in a subscope
    are only accessible for nodes within that scope.</para>

    <para>Whenever a variable is accessed, the process will search for the
    appropriate variable scope that defines the variable.  Nesting of variable
    scopes is allowed. A node will always search for a variable in its parent
    container.  If the variable cannot be found, it will look in that one's
    parent container, and so on, until the process instance itself is reached.
    If the variable cannot be found, a read access yields null, and a write
    access produces an error message, with the process continuing its
    execution.</para>

    <para>Variables can be used in various ways:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Process-level variables can be set when starting a process
        by providing a map of parameters to the invocation of the
        <code>startProcess</code> method.  These parameters will be set as
        variables on the process scope.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>Script actions can access variables directly, simply by using the
        name of the variable as a local parameter in their script.  For example, if the process
        defines a variable of type "org.jbpm.Person" in the process, a script in the process
        could access this directly:</para>
          <programlisting language="java">// call method on the process variable "person"
person.setAge(10);</programlisting>
        <para>Changing the value of a variable in a script can be done through the knowledge context:</para>
          <programlisting language="java">kcontext.setVariable(variableName, value);</programlisting>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>Service tasks (and reusable sub-processes) can pass the value of process
        variables to the outside world (or another process instance) by mapping the variable
        to an outgoing parameter.  For example, the parameter mapping of a service task could define
        that the value of the process variable x should be mapped to a task parameter y right
        before the service is being invoked.  You can also inject the value of process variable
        into a hard-coded parameter String using
        <emphasis><code>#{expression}</code></emphasis>.  For example, the description of a human
        task could be defined as <code>You need to contact person #{person.getName()}</code> (where
        person is a process variable), which will replace this expression by the actual name of the
        person when the service needs to be invoked.  Similarly results of a service (or reusable
        sub-process) can also be copied back to a variable using a result mapping.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>Various other nodes can also access data. Event nodes for
        example can store the data associated to the event in a variable, etc. 
        Check the properties of the different node types for more information.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>Process variables can be accessed also from the Java code of your application. It is
        done by casting of <code>ProcessInstance</code> to <code>WorkflowProcessInstance</code>.
        See the following example:</para>
        <programlisting language="java">variable = ((WorkflowProcessInstance) processInstance).getVariable("variableName");</programlisting>
        <para>To list all the process variables see the following code snippet:</para>
        <programlisting language="java">org.jbpm.process.instance.ProcessInstance processInstance = ...;
VariableScopeInstance variableScope = (VariableScopeInstance) processInstance.getContextInstance(VariableScope.VARIABLE_SCOPE);
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; variables = variableScope.getVariables();</programlisting>
        <para>Note that when you use persistence then you have to use a command based
        approach to get all process variables:</para>
            <programlisting language="java">Map&lt;String, Object&gt; variables = ksession.execute(new GenericCommand&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt;() {
    public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; execute(Context context) {
        StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = ((KnowledgeCommandContext) context).getStatefulKnowledgesession();
        org.jbpm.process.instance.ProcessInstance processInstance = (org.jbpm.process.instance.ProcessInstance) ksession.getProcessInstance(piId);
        VariableScopeInstance variableScope = (VariableScopeInstance) processInstance.getContextInstance(VariableScope.VARIABLE_SCOPE);
        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; variables = variableScope.getVariables();
        return variables;
    }
});</programlisting>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    <para>Finally, processes (and rules) all have access to globals, i.e.
    globally defined variables and data in the Knowledge Session.  Globals are directly
    accessible in actions just like variables.  Globals need to be defined as part of the
    process before they can be used.  You can for example define globals by clicking the
    globals button when specifying an action script in the Eclipse action property
    editor.  You can also set the value of a global from the outside using 
    <code>ksession.setGlobal(name, value)</code> or from inside process scripts using 
    <code>kcontext.getKnowledgeRuntime().setGlobal(name,value);</code>.</para>

    <title>Constraints</title>

    <para>Constraints can be used in various locations in your processes,
    for example in a diverging gateway.  jBPM supports two types of constraints:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><emphasis>Code constraints</emphasis> are boolean expressions,
        evaluated directly whenever they are reached. We currently support two
        dialects for expressing these code constraints: Java and MVEL.
        Both Java and MVEL code constraints have direct access
        to the globals and variables defined in the process.  Here is an example
        of a valid Java code constraint, <code>person</code> being a variable
        in the process:</para>
          <programlisting language="java">return person.getAge() > 20;</programlisting>
        <para>A similar example of a valid MVEL code constraint is:</para>
          <programlisting>
return person.age > 20;</programlisting>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis>Rule constraints</emphasis> are equals to normal
        Drools rule conditions.  They use the Drools Rule Language syntax to
        express possibly complex constraints.  These rules can, like any other
        rule, refer to data in the Working Memory.  They can also refer to
        globals directly.  Here is an example of a valid rule constraint:</para>
          <programlisting
>Person( age > 20 )</programlisting>
        <para>This tests for a person older than 20 being in the Working
        Memory.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    <para>Rule constraints do not have direct access to variables defined
    inside the process.  It is however possible to refer to the current process
    instance inside a rule constraint, by adding the process instance to the
    Working Memory and matching for the process instance in your rule
    constraint.  We have added special logic to make sure that a variable
    <code>processInstance</code> of type <code>WorkflowProcessInstance</code>
    will only match to the current process instance and not to other process
    instances in the Working Memory.  Note that you are however responsible
    yourself to insert the process instance into the session and, possibly,
    to update it, for example, using Java code or an on-entry or on-exit or
    explicit action in your process. The following example of a rule
    constraint will search for a person with the same name as the value
    stored in the variable "name" of the process:</para>

    <programlisting>processInstance : WorkflowProcessInstance()
Person( name == ( processInstance.getVariable("name") ) )
# add more constraints here ...</programlisting>

  <section>
    <title>Action scripts</title>

    <para>Action scripts can be used in different ways:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>Within a Script Task,</listitem>
        <listitem>As entry or exit actions, with a number of nodes.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>Actions have access to globals and the variables that are defined
    for the process and the predefined variable <code>kcontext</code>.  This
    variable is of type
    <code>org.kie.runtime.process.ProcessContext</code> and can be used for
    several tasks:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Getting the current node instance (if applicable).  The node
        instance could be queried for data, such as its name and type.  You can
        also cancel the current node instance.</para>
        <programlisting language="java">NodeInstance node = kcontext.getNodeInstance();
String name = node.getNodeName();</programlisting>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>Getting the current process instance.  A process instance
        can be queried for data (name, id, processId, etc.), aborted or
        signaled an internal event.</para>
        <programlisting language="java">ProcessInstance proc = kcontext.getProcessInstance();
proc.signalEvent( type, eventObject );</programlisting>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>Getting or setting the value of variables.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Accessing the Knowledge Runtime allows you do things
        like starting a process, signaling (external) events, inserting data,
        etc.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    <para>jBPM currently supports two dialects, Java and MVEL.
    Java actions should be valid Java code.  MVEL actions can use the business
    scripting language MVEL to express the action.  MVEL accepts any valid Java
    code but additionally provides support for nested accesses of parameters
    (e.g., <code>person.name</code> instead of <code>person.getName()</code>),
    and many other scripting improvements.  Thus, MVEL expressions are more
    convenient for the business user. For example, an action that prints out
    the name of the person in the "requester" variable of the process would
    look like this:</para>

    <programlisting>// Java dialect
System.out.println( person.getName() );

//  MVEL dialect
System.out.println( person.name );
    </programlisting>

    <title>Events</title>

        <figure>
          <title>A sample process using events</title>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

    <para>During the execution of a process, the process engine makes sure that all the relevant
    tasks are executed according to the process plan, by requesting the execution of work items
    and waiting for the results.  However, it is also possible that the process should respond to
    events that were not directly requested by the process engine.  Explicitly representing these
    events in a process allows the process author to specify how the process should react
    to such events.</para>

    <para>Events have a type and possibly data associated with them.  Users are free to define
    their own event types and their associated data.</para>

    <para>A process can specify how to respond to events by using a Message Event.  An Event
    node needs to specify the type of event the node is interested in.  It can also define
    the name of a variable, which will receive the data that is associated with the event.
    This allows subsequent nodes in the process to access the event data and take appropriate
    action based on this data.</para>

    <para>An event can be signaled to a running instance of a process in a number of ways:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Internal event: Any action inside a process (e.g., the action of an
        action node, or an on-entry or on-exit action of some node) can signal the
        occurrence of an internal event to the surrounding process instance, using code
        like the following:</para>
        <programlisting language="java">kcontext.getProcessInstance().signalEvent(type, eventData);</programlisting></listitem>
        <listitem><para>External event: A process instance can be notified of an event
        from outside using code such as:</para>
        <programlisting language="java">processInstance.signalEvent(type, eventData);</programlisting></listitem>
        <listitem><para>External event using event correlation: Instead of notifying a
        process instance directly, it is also possible to have the engine
        automatically determine which process instances might be interested
        in an event using <emphasis>event correlation</emphasis>, which is based
        on the event type.  A process instance that contains an event node
        listening to external events of some type is notified whenever such
        an event occurs. To signal such an event to the process engine, write
        code such as:</para>
        <programlisting language="java">ksession.signalEvent(type, eventData);</programlisting></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    <para>Events could also be used to start a process.  Whenever a Message Start Event
    defines an event trigger of a specific type, a new process instance will be
    started every time that type of event is signalled to the process engine.</para>

  </section>
  
  <section id="sec.timers">
    <title id="sec.timers.title">Timers</title>

    <para>Timers wait for a predefined amount of time, before triggering, once
    or repeatedly.  They can be used to trigger
    certain logic after a certain period, or to repeat some action at regular
    intervals.</para>

    <para>A Timer node is set up with a delay and a period.  The delay specifies
    the amount of time to wait after node activation before
    triggering the timer the first time.  The period defines the time between
    subsequent trigger activations. A period of 0 results in a one-shot timer.</para>
    
    <para>The (period and delay) expression should be of the form
    [#d][#h][#m][#s][#[ms]].  You can specify the amount of days,
    hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds (which is the default if you don't
    specify anything).  For example, the expression "1h" will wait one hour
    before triggering the timer (again).</para>

    <para>The timer service is responsible for making sure that timers get
    triggered at the appropriate times.  Timers can also be cancelled, meaning
    that the timer will no longer be triggered.</para>

    <para>Timers can be used in two ways inside a process:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>A Timer Event may be added to the process flow. Its activation
        starts the timer, and when it triggers, once or repeatedly, it activates the
        Timer node's successor. Subsequently, the outgoing connection of a
        timer with a positive period is triggered multiple times. Cancelling a
        Timer node also cancels the associated timer, after which no more triggers
        will occur.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Timers can be associated with a Sub-Process as a boundary event.
        This is however currently only possible when working with XML directly.  We will
        be adding support for graphically specifying this in the new BPMN2 editor.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>Updating processes</title>

  <para>Over time, processes may evolve, for example because the process itself
  needs to be improved, or due to changing requirements.  Actually, you cannot really
  update a process, you can only deploy a new version of the process, the old process
  will still exist.  That is because existing process instances might still need that
  process definition.  So the new process should have a different id, though the name
  could be the same, and you can use the version parameter to show when a process is
  updated (the version parameter is just a String and is not validated by the process
  framework itself, so you can select your own format for specifying minor/major
  updates, etc.).</para>

  <para>Whenever a process is updated, it is important to determine what should happen
  to the already running process instances.  There are various strategies one could
  consider for each running instance:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>Proceed</emphasis>: The running process instance proceeds as
      normal, following the process (definition) as it was defined when the process
      instance was started.  As a result, the already running instance will proceed as
      if the process was never updated.  New instances can be started using the updated
      process.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>Abort (and restart)</emphasis>: The already running instance
      is aborted.  If necessary, the process instance can be restarted using the new
      process definition.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>Transfer</emphasis>: The process instance is migrated to the
      new process definition, meaning that - once it has been migrated successfully -
      it will continue executing based on the updated process logic.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  <para>By default, jBPM uses the proceed approach, meaning that multiple
  versions of the same process can be deployed, but existing process instances will
  simply continue executing based on the process definition that was used when starting
  the process instance.  Running process instances could always be aborted as well of
  course, using the process management API.  Process instance migration is more difficult
  and is explained in the following paragraphs.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Process instance migration</title>

    <para>A process instance contains all the runtime information needed to continue
    execution at some later point in time.  This includes all the data linked to this
    process instance (as variables), but also the current state in the process diagram.
    For each node that is currently active, a node instance is used to represent this.
    This node instance can also contain additional state linked to the execution of that
    specific node only.  There are different types of node instances, one for each type
    of node.</para>

    <para>A process instance only contains the runtime state and is linked to a particular
    process (indirectly, using id references) that represents the process logic that needs
    to be followed when executing this process instance (this clear separation of definition
    and runtime state allows reuse of the definition across all process instances based
    on this process and minimizes runtime state).  As a result, updating a running process
    instance to a newer version so it uses the new process logic instead of the old one is
    simply a matter of changing the referenced process id from the old to the new id.</para>

    <para>However, this does not take into account that the state of the process instance (the
    variable instances and the node instances) might need to be migrated as well.  In cases
    where the process is only extended and all existing wait states are kept, this is pretty
    straightforward, the runtime state of the process instance does not need to change at all.
    However, it is also possible that a more sophisticated mapping is necessary.  For example,
    when an existing wait state is removed, or split into multiple wait states, an existing 
    process instance that is waiting in that state cannot simply be updated.  Or when a new
    process variable is introduced, that variable might need to be initiated correctly so it
    can be used in the remainder of the (updated) process.</para>

    <para>The WorkflowProcessInstanceUpgrader can be used to upgrade a workflow process
    instance to a newer process instance.  Of course, you need to provide the process instance
    and the new process id. By default, jBPM will automatically map old node instances
    to new node instances with the same id.  But you can provide a mapping of the old (unique)
    node id to the new node id.  The unique node id is the node id, preceded by the node ids
    of its parents (with a colon inbetween), to uniquely identify a node when composite
    nodes are used (as a node id is only unique within its node container.  The new node id
    is simply the new node id in the node container (so no unique node id here, simply the new
    node id).  The following code snippet shows a simple example.</para>

    <programlisting language="java">// create the session and start the process "com.sample.process"
KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = ...
StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = ...
ProcessInstance processInstance = ksession.startProcess("com.sample.process");

// add a new version of the process "com.sample.process2"
kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
kbuilder.add(..., ResourceType.BPMN2);
kbase.addKnowledgePackages(kbuilder.getKnowledgePackages());

// migrate process instance to new version
Map&lt;String, Long&gt; mapping = new HashMap&lt;String, Long&gt;();
// top level node 2 is mapped to a new node with id 3
mapping.put("2", 3L); 
// node 2, which is part of composite node 5, is mapped to a new node with id 4
mapping.put("5.2", 4L); 
WorkflowProcessInstanceUpgrader.upgradeProcessInstance(
   ksession, processInstance.getId(),
   "com.sample.process2", mapping);</programlisting>

    <para>If this kind of mapping is still insufficient, you can still describe your own custom
    mappers for specific situations.  Be sure to first disconnect the process instance, change
    the state accordingly and then reconnect the process instance, similar to how the 
    WorkflowProcessinstanceUpgrader does it.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Multi-threading</title>
   
    <para>In the following text, we will refer to two types of "multi-threading": 
    <emphasis>logical</emphasis> and <emphasis>technical</emphasis>. 
    <emphasis>Technical multi-threading</emphasis> is what happens when multiple 
    threads or processes are started on a computer, for example by a Java or 
    C program. <emphasis>Logical multi-threading</emphasis> is what we see in 
    a BPM process after the process reaches a parallel gateway, for 
    example. From a functional standpoint, the original process will then split 
    into two processes that are executed in a parallel fashion.</para>

    <para>Of course, the jBPM engine supports logical multi-threading: for example, 
    processes that include a parallel gateway. We've chosen to implement logical 
    multi-threading using one thread: a jBPM process that includes logical multi-threading 
    will only be executed in one technical thread. The main reason for doing 
    this is that multiple (technical) threads need to be be able to communicate 
    state information with each other if they are working on the same process. 
    This requirement brings with it a number of complications. While it might 
    seem that multi-threading would bring performance benefits with it, the extra 
    logic needed to make sure the different threads work together well means 
    that this is not guaranteed. There is also the extra overhead incurred because 
    we need to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.</para> 

    <section>
      <title>Engine execution</title>
   
    <para>In general, the jBPM engine executes actions in serial. For example, 
    when the engine encounters a script task in a process, it will synchronously 
    execute that script and wait for it to complete before continuing execution.  
    Similarly, if a process encounters a parallel gateway, it will sequentially 
    trigger each of the outgoing branches, one after the other. This is possible 
    since execution is almost always instantaneous, meaning that it is extremely 
    fast and produces almost no overhead. As a result, the user will usually 
    not even notice this.  Similarly, action scripts in a process are also synchronously
    executed, and the engine will wait for them to finish before continuing the 
    process. For example, doing a <code>Thread.sleep(...)</code> as part of 
    a script will not make the engine continue execution elsewhere but will 
    block the engine thread during that period.</para>
    
    <para>The same principle applies to service tasks. When a service task is 
    reached in a process, the engine will also invoke the handler of this service 
    synchronously.  The engine will wait for the <code>completeWorkItem(...)</code> 
    method to return before continuing execution. It is important that your 
    service handler executes your service asynchronously if its execution is 
    not instantaneous.</para>
    
    <para>An example of this would be a service task that invokes an external 
    service.  Since the delay in invoking this service remotely and waiting for 
    the results might be too long, it might be a good idea to invoke this service 
    asynchronously. This means that the handler will only invoke the service 
    and will notify the engine later when the results are available.  In the 
    mean time, the process engine then continues execution of the process.  
    </para>
    
    <para>Human tasks are a typical example of a service that needs to be invoked 
    asynchronously, as we don't want the engine to wait until a human actor 
    has responded to the request. The human task handler will only create a new task 
    (on the task list of the assigned actor) when the human task node is triggered. 
    The engine will then be able to continue execution on the rest of the process 
    (if necessary) and the handler will notify the engine asynchronously when 
    the user has completed the task.</para>
    
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Asynchronous handlers</title>
      
      <para>How can we implement an asynchronous service handler? To start with, 
      this depends on the technology you're using.  If you're only using 
      Java, you could execute the actual service in a new thread:</para>
      
      <programlisting language="java">public class MyServiceTaskHandler implements WorkItemHandler {
        
  public void executeWorkItem(WorkItem workItem, WorkItemManager manager) {
    new Thread(new Runnable() {
      public void run() {
        // Do the heavy lifting here ...
      }
    }).start();
  }

  public void abortWorkItem(WorkItem workItem, WorkItemManager manager) {
  }
      
}</programlisting>

      <para>It's advisable to have your handler contact a service that 
      executes the business operation, instead of having it perform the actual 
      work.  If anything goes wrong with a business operation, it doesn't affect 
      your process. The loose coupling that this provides also gives you greater 
      flexibility in reusing services and developing them. </para>
      
      <para>For example, you can have your human task handler simply invoke the 
      human task service to add a task there. To implement an asynchronous handler, 
      you usually have to simply do an asynchronous invocation of this service.  
      This usually depends on the technology you use to do the communication, 
      but this might be as simple as asynchronously invoking a web service, 
      or sending a JMS message to the external service.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Multiple knowledge sessions and persistence</title>

    <para>The simplest way to run multiple processes is to run them all using 
    one knowledge session. However, there are cases in which it's necessary
    to run multiple processes in different knowledge sessions, even in
    different (technical) threads. Both are supported by jBPM.</para>

    <para>When we add persistence (using a database, for example) to a situation
    in which we have multiple knowledge sessions (and processes), there is a 
    guideline that users should be aware of. The following paragraphs explain 
    why this guideline is important to follow. 
    <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>Please make sure to use a database that allows row-level locks 
       as well as table-level locks.</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para> 

    <para>For example, a user could have a situation in which there are 2 
    (or more) threads running, each with its own knowledge session instance. 
    On each thread, jBPM processes are being started using the local knowledge 
    session instance.</para>

    <para>In this use case, a race condition exists in which both thread A and 
    thread B will have coincidentally simultaneously finished a process. At 
    this point, because persistence is being used, both thread A and B will 
    be commiting changes to the databse. If row-level locks are 
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> possible, then the following situation can occur: 
    <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>Thread A has a lock on the <code>ProcessInstanceInfo</code> table, having just
       committed a change to that table.</listitem>
       <listitem>Thread A <emphasis>wants</emphasis> a lock on the <code>SessionInfo</code> table
       in order to commit a change there.</listitem>
       <listitem>Thread B has the opposite situation: it has a lock on the <code>SessionInfo</code>
       table, having just committed a change there.</listitem>
       <listitem>Thread B <emphasis>wants</emphasis> a lock on the <code>ProcessInstanceInfo</code>
       table, even though Thread <emphasis>A</emphasis> already has a lock on it</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    This is a deadlock situation which the database and application will not be able to solve. 
    </para> 

    <para>However, if row-level locks are posible (and enabled!!) in the database (and tables used), 
    then this situation will not occur.</para>
