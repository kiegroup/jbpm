  <title>Testing and debugging</title>

  <para>Even though business processes aren't code (we even recommend you to make them as
  high-level as possible and to avoid adding implementation details), they also have a life 
  cycle like other development artefacts. And since business processes can be updated 
  dynamically, testing them (so that you don't break any use cases when doing a modification) 
  is really important as well.</para>
  
  <section>
    <title>Unit testing</title>

  <para>When unit testing your process, you test whether the process behaves as expected 
  in specific use cases, for example test the output based on the existing input. To 
  simplify unit testing, jBPM includes a helper class called JbpmJUnitTestCase (in the 
  drools-bpmn2 test module) that you can use to greatly simplify your junit testing, 
  by offering:</para>

    <listitem>helper methods to create a new knowledge base and session for a given (set of)
      process(es)

    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>For example, conside the following hello world process containing a start event,
  a script task and an end event. The following junit test will create a new session, 
  start the process and then verify whether the process instance completed successfully
  and whether these three nodes have been executed.</para>

      <title>Testing integration with external services</title>

    <para>Real-life business processes typically include the invocation of external
    services (like for example a human task service, an email server or your own
    domain-specific services).  One of the advantages of our domain-specific process
    approach is that you can specify yourself how to actually execute your own
    domain-specific nodes, by registering a handler.  And this handler can be different
    depending on your context, allowing you to use testing handlers for unit testing
    your process.  When you are unit testing your business process, you can register
    test handlers that then verify whether specific services are requested correctly, and 
    provide test responses for those services. For example, imagine you have an email 
    node or a human task as part of your process. When unit testing, you don't want to 
    send out an actual email but rather test whether the email that is requested contains 
    the correct information (for example the right to email, a personalized body, etc.).
    </para>
    
    <para>A TestWorkItemHandler is provided by default that can be registered to collect
    all work items (a work item represents one unit of work, like for example sending one
    specific email or invoking one specific service and contains all the data related to
    that task) for a given type.  This test handler can then be queried during unit testing
    to check whether specific work was actually requested during the execution of the process
    and that the data associcated with the work was correct.</para>

    <para>The following example describes how a process that sends out an email could be
    tested. This test case in particular will test whether an exception is raised when the
    email could not be sent (which is simulated by notifying the engine that the sending
    the email could not be completed). The test case uses a test handler that simply 
    registers when an email was requested (and allows you to test the data related to the 
    email like from, to, etc.). Once the engine has been notified the email could not be 
    sent (using abortWorkItem(..)), the unit test verifies that the process handles this 
    case successfully by logging this and generating an error, which aborts the process 
    instance in this case.</para>

    TestWorkItemHandler testHandler = new TestWorkItemHandler();
    ksession.getWorkItemManager().registerWorkItemHandler("Email", testHandler);
    // start the process
    ProcessInstance processInstance = ksession.startProcess("com.sample.bpmn.hello2");
    assertProcessInstanceActive(processInstance.getId(), ksession);
    assertNodeTriggered(processInstance.getId(), "StartProcess", "Email");
    // check whether the email has been requested
    WorkItem workItem = testHandler.getWorkItem();
    assertNotNull(workItem);
    assertEquals("Email", workItem.getName());
    assertEquals("me@mail.com", workItem.getParameter("From"));
    assertEquals("you@mail.com", workItem.getParameter("To"));
    // notify the engine the email has been sent
    ksession.getWorkItemManager().abortWorkItem(workItem.getId());

    <section>
      <title>Configuring persistence</title>

    <para>You can configure whether you want to execute the junit tests using persistence
    or not.  By default, the junit tests will use persistence, meaning that the state of all
    process instances will be stored in a (in-memory H2) database (which is started by the
    junit test during setup) and a history log will be used to check assertions related to
    execution history.  When persistence is not used, process instances will only live in
    memory and an in-memory logger is used for history assertions.</para>
    
    <para>By default, persistence is turned on.  To turn off persistence, simply pass
    a boolean to the super constructor when creating your test case, as shown below:</para>
    
<programlisting language="java">public class MyProcessTest extends JbpmJUnitTestCase {

    public MyProcessTest() {
        // configure this tests to not use persistence in this case
        super(false);
    }
    
    ...

    <title>Debugging</title>

      <para>This section describes how to debug processes using the Eclipse plugin.  This
      means that the current state of your running processes can be inspected
  and visualized during the execution.  Note that we currently don't
  allow you to put breakpoints on the nodes within a process directly.
  You can however put breakpoints inside any
  Java code you might have (i.e. your application code that is invoking
  the engine or invoked by the engine, listeners, etc.) or inside rules 
  (that could be evaluated in the context of a process).  At these
  breakpoints, you can then inspect the internal state of all your process instances.
  </para>

    <para>When debugging the application, you can use the following debug views to
    track the execution of the process:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>The process instances view, showing all running process instances (and 
        their state).  When double-clicking a process instance, the process instance view
        visually shows the current state of that process instance at that point in time.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>The human task view, showing the task list of the given user (fill in the
        user id of the actor and click refresh to view all the tasks for the given actor),
        where you can then control the life cycle of the task, for example start and complete
        it.</listitem>
        <listitem>The audit view, showing the audit log (note that you should probably
        use a threaded file logger if you want to session to save the audit event to the 
        file system on regular intervals, so the audit view can be update to show the latest
        state).</listitem>
        <listitem>The global data view, showing the globals.</listitem>
        <listitem>Other views related to rule execution like the working memory view 
        (showing the contents (data) in the working memory related to rule execution), the
        agenda view (showing all activated rules), etc.</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

    <section>
      <title>The Process Instances View</title>

      <para>The process instances view shows the currently running process instances.
      The example shows that there is currently one running process (instance),
      currently executing one node instance, i.e. business rule task. When double-clicking
      a process instance, the process instance viewer will graphically show the progress
      of the process instance.  An example where the process instance is waiting for a human
      actor to perform a self-evaluation task is shown below.</para>

                     fileref="images/Chapter-Testing/process-instances.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>When you double-click a process instance in the process instances view and
      the process instance view complains that it cannot find the process, this means
      that the plugin wasn't able to find the process definition of the selected process
      instance in the cache of parsed process definitions.  To solve this, simply change
      the process definition in question and save again (so it will be parsed) or rebuild
      the project that contains the process definition in question.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The Human Task View</title>
      
      <para>The Human Task View can connect to a running human task service and request the 
      relevant tasks for a particular user (i.e. the tasks where the user is either a 
      potential owner or the tasks that the user already claimed and is executing).
      The life cycle of these tasks can then be executed, i.e. claiming or releasing a task,
      starting or stopping the execution of a task, completing a task, etc. A screenshot of
      this Human Task View is shown below. You can configure which task service to connect
      to in the Drools Task preference page (select Window -> Preferences and select Drools
      Task). Here you can specify the url and port (default = 127.0.0.1:9123).</para>

    <section>
      <title>The Audit View</title>
      <para>The audit view, showing the audit log, which is a log of all events that
      were logged from the session.  To create a logger, use the KnowledgeRuntimeLoggerFactory
      to create a new logger and attach it to a session.  Note that you should probably
        use a threaded file logger if you want to session to save the audit event to the 
        file system on regular intervals, so the audit view can be update to show the latest
        state.  When creating a threaded file logger, you can specify the name of the file
        where the audit log should be created and the interval after which event should be 
        saved to the file (in milliseconds).  Be sure to close the logger after usage.</para>
        
      <programlisting language="java">KnowledgeRuntimeLogger logger = KnowledgeRuntimeLoggerFactory
   .newThreadedFileLogger(ksession, "logdir/mylogfile", 1000);
// do something with the session here
logger.close();
      </programlisting>
      
      <para>To open up an audit tree in the audit view, open the selected log file in the audit
      view or simply drag the file into the audit view.  A tree-based view is generated based
      on the audit log.  An event is shown as a subnode of another event if the child event is
      caused by (a direct consequence of) the parent event.  An example is shown below.</para>
